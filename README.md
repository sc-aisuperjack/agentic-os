# 🚀 AI Superjack: Agentic OS v2.0

**Enterprise-Grade Autonomous Marketing & ROI Growth Mesh**

AI Superjack Agentic OS by Stefanos Cunning is a distributed, microservice-based AI operating system designed to orchestrate frontier models (**Gemini 1.5/3 Pro**, **GPT-4o/5.2**) into coordinated marketing "swarms." Built for 2026 growth standards, it leverages **LangGraph** for stateful orchestration, **FastAPI** for high-throughput async processing, and **Docker** for containerized scalability.

## 🧠 Core Architecture

The system operates as a **High-Concurrency Agentic Mesh**, ensuring total separation of concerns and high availability.

- **⚡ The Nginx Gateway:** The bouncer of the mesh. Handles routing, rate limiting (10r/s), and secure transparent handoffs to internal services.
- **🧠 The Central Orchestrator:** The "Brain" of the OS. Uses a compiled LangGraph engine to dynamically discover agents and route tasks based on "Capability Intelligence."
- **🤖 Specialized Agent Workers:**
  - **Researcher (Gemini 3 Pro):** High-context data ingestion and real-time marketing trend analysis.
  - **Strategist (GPT-5.2/4o):** Advanced reasoning node that synthesizes research into board-ready ROI roadmaps.
- **💾 Distributed Memory:** Powered by **Redis Stack** (Semantic Cache) and **MongoDB** (Persistence) to ensure the hive mind never forgets a winning strategy.
